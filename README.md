How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

  When interpreting a users needs, we need to be able to find out all of the information and guidelines the user may have. In order to implement these, the creation of user stories will be a huge help. Creating user stories allows us to break down a larger task the user may need into multiple smaller projects that teams can work on and prioritize those tasks. User stories will also aid in determining acceptance criteria and also estimating the amount of time a task will take.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

  When I approach programs, I first gather all of the information and guidelines needed to complete the project from the person requesting the project. Agile Scrum processes that I hope to incorporate in my future development work would be user stories as well as test cases. Both of these are very useful when it comes to product development due to the ability to organize, estimate time, identify acceptance criteria, and prioritize different aspects of a project.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

  To be a good team member in software development means being respectful and also being there for those in your team to help with problems they may be having. Being a good team member also means not being afraid to ask questions if you are having troubles understanding a task, this will ensure that the entire team stays on track. Another example of being a good team member is to challenge others around you to develop their skills while aiding when possible.
